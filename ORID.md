I have learnt how to use interceptor to handle error and add custom header. I have also learnt some basics of cloud native.

# R
Interesting

# I
In my past projects, I always thought that error handling has to be done request by request. Interceptor has provided me a better way for handling error globally. Also, as I have taken courses on cloud computing at university, today's lecture on cloud native basics has help me to revise the existing knowledge.

# D
I would adapt interceptor in my future projects. Also, as I am a part of cloud and framework team, I will spend more time to study cloud native related subject.
